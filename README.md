### Origins
When I was first playing with SFML in 2016, I was trying to make a gravity simulator. It was a program that would simulate dynamic orbits. But while I was making it, I make an error in the acceleration force application, and the orbits would always spin out of control in a beautiful oscillating dance.  I liked it more than the gravity simulator and decided to make it an art program of some sort. This is a rebuld of a rebuild of the original, which has basicaly become lost to time. We'll see how it goes.
